Q - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A - It creates a .git file. We need to do it so as to keep track of the changes we have made.

Q - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A - staging area contains file we need to commit a time but working directory contains the files that have been commmited.

Q - How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

A - Staging area is the space where file that needs to be commited is kept. So, before commiting a change staging area is checked to make sure that there is one commit per logical change.  

Q - What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
