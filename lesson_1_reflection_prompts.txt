Q - How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
A - The minus sign shows what lines of codes has been removed from the the original file and the plus sign shows what new lines of codes has been created in the new file. Thus helping in figuring out the bug introduced.

Q - How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
